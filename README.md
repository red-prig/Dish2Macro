
This macro modifed by Red_prig for use with any game or progam.

Just put Title of need game in Titlename.txt



A macro for Dishonored 2 (and since then also Dishonored: Death of the Outsider and Dishonored 1),
that allows you to bunnyhop without a freescroll mouse.

Oh, and don't forget to bind `wheel down` to jump in game.

# Downloading and installing

**The big green "Clone or download"-button is for the source code, not the program itself!**

# Dish2Macro.txt

If you don't like using `space` you can change it in `Dish2Macro.txt` to a different key code.

For a list of these key codes see [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd375731(v=vs.85).aspx).

Here are a few sample configuration files:

 - Bind `space` to spamming `wheel down`.
    - `32` or
    - `0x20` or
    - `0x20 Down` or
    - `0x20 0x0`
 - Bind `space` to spamming `wheel up`.
    - `0x20 Up` or
    - `0x0 0x20`
 - Bind `middle mouse button` (pressing the wheel itself) to spamming `wheel down`. (This is my preferred setup for Dishonored 2/Death of the Outsider.)
    - `0x4 Down`
 - Bind `G` to spamming `wheel down`. (This is my preferred setup for Dishonored 1.)
    - `0x47 Down`
 - Bind `G` to spamming `wheel down`, and `H` to spamming `wheel up`.
    - `0x47 0x48`

and so on...

# Is this allowed in speedruns?

Yes.

Specifically any of the Dishonored games allow it.
